In this project we will learn about how routing works ,and how we can use the react-router-dom for creating a single page application.

For this project we will be using the v6 of the react-router-dom and see two ways of how we can implement routing.

The react-router-dom comes with few useful components which we can ues to implement routing in our application , these are

- BrowserRouter
- Routes
- Route
- Link
- NavLink.
- Outlet

By defalut when we use the anchor tag to move to different pages , the browser performs a hard reload and reloads the entire page , but if we want to stop this we can use the Link insted of the a tag, the `Link` has an attribute as `to` which is used to specify the path of the desired page.
